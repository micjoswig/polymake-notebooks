# polymake-notebooks
Collection of ipynb with [polymake](https://www.polymake.org/) showcases.

[polymake](https://github.com/polymake) is open source software for polyhedral geometry and related topics in mathematics and applications.
Most Linux distributions have packages; Windows 10 is supported via WSL.
MacOS is supported, too.
The full source code is available also from this [(squashed) read-only mirror](https://github.com/polymake/polymake).

While C++ and Perl are polymake's native languages, there are interfaces from [Julia](https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl) and [Python](https://pypi.org/project/pypolymake/).
